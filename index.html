With Azure Stack, GKE, VMWare on AWS, and recent announcements about AWS Outposts, it is clear that the line between public clouds and on-premises infrastructures and services is blurring. Recent developments in the industry, such as merger between Hadoop rivals Cloudera & Hortonworks, as well as IBM's acquisition of RedHat, indicate a trend that an exciting hybrid cloud future awaits us. Public clouds entering on-premises means same logically centralized control planes (and associated managed services) will be available on both public clouds, and on-premises, making hybrid data planes possible. In addition, software systems deployment targets, which until recently were limited to bare metal and heavyweight virtual machines, have proliferated. They now include a hierarchy: Bare metal physical machines, Virtual Machines, MicroVMs, Containers, Isolates, & Functions. This fundamentally changes how distributed data platforms and data-intensive applications will be developed. This talk outlines the architectural building blocks that can be used in specific design patterns for developing modern distributed data platforms. We will draw from our experiences in developing a prominent distributed data analytics platform, Apache Hadoop, and outline how such a platform could be built today with modern building blocks. We intend to cover most aspects of the platform control planes such as high availability, disaster recovery, security, resource scheduling, orchestration, resource isolation, allocation, management, monitoring, scaling, metrics, metering, and logging. I will illustrate this architectural paradigm shift with some of the design choices we have made at Ampool, a modern data analytics platform.</p></div><a class="read-more">EXPAND</a><a class="collapse">COLLAPSE</a><div class="section-schedule-item__right--speaker"><div class="section-schedule-item__right--speaker-left"><img src="assets/img/milind-bhandarkar.jpg" alt="Milind Bhandarkar"></div><div class="section-schedule-item__right--speaker-right"><p>Dr. Milind Bhandarkar</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section-schedule-item schedule-grey"><div class="section-schedule-item__left"><p>10:30 AM</p></div><div class="section-schedule-item__right"><h3>Tea Break</h3></div></div><div class="section-schedule-item" id="time-1100am"><div class="section-schedule-item__left"><p>11:00 AM</p></div><div class="section-schedule-item__right"><h3>Applying The Universal Scalability Law to Distributed Systems</h3><div class="section-schedule-item__right--text"><p>When I originally developed the Universal Scalability Law (USL), it was in the context of tightly-coupled Unix multiprocessors, which led to an inherent dependency between the serial contention term and the data consistency term in the USL, i.e., no contention, no coherency penalty. Later, I realized that the USL could have broader applicability to large-scale clusters if this dependency was removed. In this talk I will show examples of how the USL can be applied as a statistical regression model to a variety of large-scale distributed systems, such as, Hadoop, Zookeeper, Sirius, AWS cloud, and Avalanche DLT, in order to quantify their scalability in terms of numerical concurrency, contention, and coherency.</p></div><a class="read-more">EXPAND</a><a class="collapse">COLLAPSE</a><p class="section-schedule-item--live"><span></span>Livestream</p><div class="section-schedule-item__right--speaker"><div class="section-schedule-item__right--speaker-left"><img src="assets/img/neil-gunther.jpg" alt="Neil J.
